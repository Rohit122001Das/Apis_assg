    "\n",
    "Ans > 1.> Automation :\n",
    "     When using an API managed by computers, less human effort is required and workflows can be      easily updated to become faster and more productive. Furthermore, new content and                information can be published and shared with your entire audience quickly and efficiently        across all channels. \n",
    "\n",
    " 2.>Developer efficiency and innovation :\n",
    "         APIs empower developers to be more productive by reusing code in complex but repetitive processes. They don’t need                  to start from scratch as the API specifies how to assemble software components in a program. APIs exist to make it                  easy to interface with other developers' applications.\n",
    "\n",
    " 3.> Improved value proposition :\n",
    "              By using APIs made available by companies such as Amazon, Salesforce, or Twitter, an application can integrate those               services into their own systems to make themselves more attractive to customers."
